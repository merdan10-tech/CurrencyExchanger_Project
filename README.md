<h1>Currency Exchanger</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This program takes user-provided input for the original currency, target currency, and the amount to be exchanged. It utilizes a dictionary containing exchange rates and processes the conversion. If the provided inputs are valid, the program calculates the converted amount, rounds it to two decimal places, and appends the user's name and the converted amount to an 'new_currencies.txt' file. In the case of invalid currency inputs, the program records an error message, providing a valuable tool for currency conversion and error logging
